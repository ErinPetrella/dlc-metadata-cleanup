   <note>The note is dated 9 June 1868, and was written by Tillman C. Howbridge, an American missionary, in Istanbul. Howbridge recorded that he had received this Quran manuscript from his Turkish teacher Arif Bey, when he was living in Erzurum, in eastern Anatolia while Howbridge's Turkish teacher could not give him an approximate date for the manuscript, a Turkish acquaintance told him in Istanbul that the manuscript was about 300 years old</note>
   <note type="ownership">In the bottom right corner, there is a second note, dated 20 May 1883 and stating that Howbridge's nephew - his name is illegible - sold the Quran manuscript to the library of Union Theological Seminary</note>
