This excerpt from his memoirs concerns the Beilis ritual murder case. On March 20, 1911, the mutilated body of a twelve-year-old boy was discovered in a cave near Kiev, Ukraine. Although a police investigation pointed to a gang of thieves, pressure from anti-Semitic organizations led to the arrest of a Jewish scapegoat, Menahem Mendel Beilis. The Beilis trial attracted worldwide attention, inspiring protests and public outcries by political leaders, artists, clergymen, and many others. Beilis was imprisoned for more than two years, found not guilty, and with his family left Russia for the Land of Israel. In 1920 he settled in the United States. He died in 1934 in New York and was buried in the Bronx.

The Chamber was chartered by King George III in 1770, hence the date MDCCLXX. The complete Latin phrase “non nobis solum nati sumus” translates as “We are not born for ourselves alone.”

Wood’s commission to paint the Chamber seal might have been generated by a renewed nationwide interest in early American history, spurred by the Centennial celebration of 1876. The painting was executed seven years after the centennial of the Chamber’s royal charter.","Gift of the Partnership for New York City, Inc.

Sir:

The Chamber of Commerce has expressed a desire to cooperate with me in regard to the defences of this City, and to render any aid in their power to place the City in a defensive condition.

I have represented to the Secretary of War of the necessity of a ship of war, or several gunboats to be placed between the Narrows and Sandy Hook. The Alabama or any other armed vessel could enter the Bay and destroy many vessels without the fear of being molested or interfered with. 

I ask your influence to hasten what I have required. The sooner it is done the better it will be for your City and would not fail to quiet the apprehensions of the citizens.
	
			I have the honor to be very respectfully

P. Perrit Esqr.
President, Chamber of Commerce N.Y.	

Your obt Servt.
John E. Wool

	Before considering, however, the means of supply, your Committee have thought proper to inquire into the need of such an auxiliary to the fire department, and they find that in the lower part of the city, within a few years, dwelling houses have every where given way to spacious stores, deep and high, filled with the most costly merchandise; so that at the present time, the amount of property exposed to destruction bears a vastly greater proportion to the population of the district than hitherto.
	Should a fire break out at night, and not be subdued immediately, the want of men might be seriously felt. But despite every endeavor to subdue it, the conflagration will sometimes extend, and while the arm of man tires, the devouring element continually gathers strength. It needs then to be opposed by an agent as powerful and unwearying as itself, and the superiority of steam over manual labor, it is believed, may be made to appear as conspicuous and decided in this as in any other way. The value of such an agent is indeed obvious enough, but there are difficulties in the way of its application; the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient head of steam in a short time, and that of uniting safety with a sufficiently compact construction (new page).
	Your Committee have been called to discuss the working of an engine built by Messrs. Lee and Larned, which is considered to combine these properties more successfully than any other, and yet during the experiment witnessed by them, the requisite head of steam was not maintained owing to some temporary malfunction. Good results are said to have been obtained in Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans – such as to warrant your Committee in urging by their recommendation the introduction of similar machines here. If important any where, they are so in the city of New York, and especially in the lower wards. If in the places referred to merchants and boards of trade have contributed to so important an acquisition, and the need of such a stimulus is felt by our Common Council, the example is worthy of imitation, an your Committee commend it to the consideration of the Fire Companies, who have a direct interest in the matter.
	The Union Ferry Company, alive to the importance of this subject, have, it appears, in addition to the ordinary fire department of their boats, recently added two Steam Fire Engines, constructed especially with reference to the extinguishment of fires amongst the sipping and along the shore. Communicating with the water through the bottom of the boat, and with cylinders so large that they can be worked with a pressure of five pounds to the inch, these Engines are always in readiness for action, and in many cases have proved their efficiency. Five copious streams of water can be ejected simultaneously from one boat, and the strength of the hose yields before the power of the Engine is exhausted. Through the courtesy of the Directors of the Ferry Company, your Committee have been permitted to witness the (new page) operation of one of these pumps, and they were much impressed with the importance of the application. Nothing but the expense prevents the extension of it to the other boats of the Company. The cost in each of engine + hose would not exceed $2000 or about one fourth the price of a fire engine on shore.
	But the advantages of ferry boats as an auxiliary to the fire department are manifold. Always warm and receiving water from beneath out of the reach of ice, they are available in the coldest weather, when hydrants and hose are sometimes rendered useless. Fully manned, with pilots ever on the watch, possessing within themselves the means of locomotion, and ready on the instant to repair to points and places otherwise inaccessible, they have at the same time the power to withdraw ships exposed to peril to a place of safety. In the outlay incurred by the company, your Committee believe the Directors have been moved by a simple desire to serve the public. They are understood to be willing to render still invaluable and gratuitous service, and to extend their mans of usefulness by adding new pumps to other boats, if those who are to be benefited will bear the necessary expense. 
	They cannot of course subject their boats to the control of the Corporation of New York, or Brooklyn, nor pledge any assistance that is incompatible with the paramount duty of keeping the communication between the two cities always open, yet, under all necessary limitations, your Committee cannot fail to recognize the importance of securing the cooperation of such an agency for the protection of our shipping. A million of dollars have been destroyed in a single night and if timely measures are not adopted, a similar loss of property may again occur amongst the shipping at our wharves. 
	The Marine Companies of this City are interested in the adoption of every measure that will tend to the preservation of property in the harbor; and your Committee feel that they will have performed an important duty, if they succeed through the action of this chamber, in commending their attention to that now considered.

	Respectfully submitted,

				Chamber of Commerce, New York, Nov. 13, 1861

	To his Excellency Abraham Lincoln,
			President of the U. States,

	The Memorial of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York respectfully represents that the subject now held under consideration by your Excellency, touching the power and jurisdiction of the Provost Judge of Alexandria in certain actions of debt brought before him, involves questions of the deepest import to the mercantile interests of the country. Citizens of states now in rebellion owe to citizens of loyal states a commercial debt estimated at little less than $200.000.000. At present there are no means of collecting any portion of these debts, nor can there be until the authority of the United States government is reestablished in the rebellious states. In fact these states have made the payment of any such debt a criminal offence of the highest grade, and they have also provided by law for their confiscation and appropriation to the uses of the rebel government.
	Under these circumstances the unfortunate creditors are constrained to look to their government for relief. They are aware that government can grant this relief only in the degree in which its authority is reestablished; but to that extent (new page) they feel that they have a right to claim, on the grounds of justice and sound policy, its friendly and earnest interposition. The restoration of United States authority will follow the march of the federal army, and must thus be accomplished by degrees. It has already commenced. The district of Alexandria, in the State of Virginia, is now within the lines of the federal army. No civil authority exists there, but a Military Governor has been appointed and a Provost Court established. Your memorialists respectfully submit that, under such circumstances, it is an imperative necessity that these military authorities should exercise all the functions of local government. A state of war does not destroy the social relations of men; and unless there exists in its immediate presence some kind of authority to protect  the rights of person and property and to enforce the obligations of contract, it would leave no traces of property behind it to satisfy the claims of creditors or others.  
	It is therefore of the highest importance that loyal citizens should have means of enforcing their claims against debtors in reconquered districts during the transition stat when the military is the only existing power. If their legal rights be postponed until the reestablishment of civil tribunals it is not (new page) likely that any property will be found to satisfy their claims. The chances are that most of it will have been appropriated to disloyal purposes. 
	Again, the honest and loyal debtor in the reconquered district, who should desire to prosecute his business and pay his debts, would find himself greatly embarrassed by the crushing competition of disloyalists and others intending to put their creditors at defiance. This very difficulty, it is said has already been felt at Alexandria.
	The political effect of this temporary immunity, if it were granted to rebel debtors, could not fail to prove most injurious to the federal cause; for it could scarcely be expected that rebels would become loyal when loyalty would deprive them of a plausible ground for refusing to satisfy the just demands of their creditors. The immunity, in short, would be equivalent to paying a premium for treason. 
	For the reasons stated your memorialists deem it essential to justice and to the early suppression of this wicked rebellion, as well as due to the mercantile interest of the country which has sustained the government with such patriotic zeal and liberality, that the action of the Provost (new page) Court at Alexandria should be sustained by the Administration; and that it should also be the invariable practice to establish such courts with plenary power in civil causes in every district that falls into the military possession of the U. States government. It is said that the practice of this government in California for some two years after that territory came into its possession afforded a precedent for the adoption of this policy. But whether this be so or not, there can be no doubt but justice and expediency (new page) alike demand its adoption in the present exigency. The rules and usages of war and governed by the necessities that exist in its actual presence subject only to such restraints as justice, mercy and other principles of Christianity impose. It will infringe none of these to compel the disloyal debtor to appropriate his property to the payment of debts justly due to loyal creditors.
	Your memorialists, therefore, respectfully urge your Excellency to sanction the action of the Alexandria Court, and to establish similar tribunals wherever the federal army establishes its authority in a rebellious city or district.

Gentlemen of the Chamber,

	I am permitted to occupy the chair at this time for the purpose of making an explanatory statement
	at the meeting of the Chamber held on Thursday, the 2nd inst., a difficulty occurred between two of its members who have zealously co-operate, hitherto, in the charge of its affairs, an who have been equally distinguished for their active interest in all that concerns the welfare of our city, State and Country: both occupying a high social standing in the community an a prominent position among the merchants of this city.
	The difficulty occurred in this wise: at the close of a lengthy session, Captain Marshall presented a communication from E.A. Stevens, Esq., of Hoboken, inviting the members to witness certain experiments intended to illustrate the advantages of his “Steam Ram” or “Battery.” 
	Thereupon, General Wetmore moved to accept the invitation and appoint a committee to examine and report to the Chamber.
	The rule of the Chamber is that all resolutions shall be offered in writing. The hour being late, the rule was not complied with, and, in the instance referred to, it was not deemed to be of necessary application. Its observance would have prevented the trouble that followed.
	Mr. Phelps objected to the appointment of a Committee, and was understood by the Chair to do so simply because an examination of, and report upon, the “Stevens Battery” id not properly come within the sphere of the Chamber’s duties.
	In the discussion that ensued, Mr. Phelps understood Mr. Duer ??? as treating his opposition to the motion for the appointment of a committee, as indicating a want of interst in the Sea-Coast defences, and in a manner reflecting on the patriotism of the first vice President of the Chamber.
	The following Mr. Duer gives as the words he used on the occasion: “I am surprised to hear the First Vice President of this Chamber declare that the Chamber has nothing to do with the defences of the Harbor. The Chamber decided otherwise when they appointed a Committee last summer to examine into the defences of the Harbor and report to the Chamber.” 
	The question was distinctly put and decided in the affirmative, and declared to the meeting. 
	Mr. Phelps then enquired of the Chair if the vote carried with it a decision to appoint a Committee, and remarked that the Chamber did not so understand it. 
Mr. Duer immediately said: The Chamber understands what it is doing if Mr. Phelps does not. (at this point of the proceedings, Mr. D. was about to move a re-consideration, and his observation, he assures me, was intended as a preface to it.)
Mr. Phelps, however, arose at once, in a state of excitement, and turning towards Mr. Duer, upbraided him for the misconstruction put upon his motives on this and previous occasions. While yet speaking, Mr. Duer arose on his feet, called Mr. Phelps to order, which the efforts of the chair, perhaps too feebly exerted, failed to enforce. During the confusion a motion to adjourn was put and carried.
The controversy which had assumed a personal character before the adjournment was resumed immediately afterwards. In disregard of the sanctities of the Chamber, and in the absence of a proper self control, both parties permitted themselves to use expressions to each other of a most offensive and hostile character.
Fortunately for human nature, the keenest sensibilities co-exist with traits of character the noblest and most generous. In all right minded men, however quick to resent an injury, the desire to repair a fault and redress a wrong, is the first impulse of duty, and it is a proud thing that is as honorable as it is praiseworthy.
In meeting here to day, such I understand to be the disposition of the two gentlemen who were unhappily betrayed, in a moment of excitement, into expressions which they mutually feel to have been unworthy of themselves, as they were unjust to each other.
And I have great pleasure in saying that they mutually retract the offensive words spoken at the time, and under the circumstances referred to; - that in consequence thereof no stain may rest upon the annals of the annals of the Chamber; - that they may stand in the presence of each other, now as heretofore, in the attitude of friends with “consciences void of offense.”
___________

The statement made by Mr. Low having been made, remarks followed by Msrs. R. Phelps and Duer, in keeping with Mr. Low’s paper and expressing regret that the circumstances had transpired as narrated.
Remarks were also made by Msrs Perit, Sturges, Marshall, and Solomon. Mr. Low, Vice President, and as chairman of the meeting 2nd inst. was desired to prepare a statement for the press, as to the circumstances named, at the suggestion of Mr. Jonathan Sturges. 

There being no further business for consideration, the Chamber then adjourned. 
				J. Smith Homans, Secretary

Dear Sir

	I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of April 26th, inviting me to be present at the presentation of the Fort Sumter Medals. As this communication was only received yesterday I was of course unable to comply with the invitation.
	Although conscious, on the occasion alluded to, that I did no more than my simple duty in defending the flag of our country against traitors, I am none the less grateful for the compliment of this medal the possession of which will always be to me a source of the highest gratification.
	My address is Willards Hotel, Washington, D.C.

				I have the honor to be
				Very Respectfully
					Your Obedient Serv’t

""Enos M. Johnson (left) of Brooklyn, hands rare volume over to Dr. Richard H. Logsdon, associate director of the Columbia University Libraries. The book, entitled ""A System of Natural Philosophy,"" was drawn from the shelves of the old King's College library in 1772 -- a dozen years before King's College became Columbia. It was recently discovered by Mr. Johnston as he rummaged through the attic at the home of his aunt, Miss Susan Ruggles of Binghamton, N.Y.  The scholar who borrowed the book was Robert Harpur, one-time librarian of King's College and tutor of Alexander Hamilton.  It was not regarded as ""overdue"" at the University library, which was fortunate in view of the fact that a considerable fine would have been in order. The fine, calculated at the rate of five cents per day, would have totaled $3,248.50. Dr. Logsdon expressed the Library's gratitude for the return of the volume. 'The Library is especially happy to have this historic volume come back into its possession,' said Dr. Logsdon. 'We are most grateful to Mr. Johnston. The book, spanning virtually all of Columbia's life through nearly two centuries of American history, will serves as an interesting item for exhibition in Columbia's coming Bicentennial celebration in 1954.""

On October 10, 1889, the day of the cornerstone laying for the World Building, three reporters for Joseph Pulitzer's New York World went into a room at the offices of the Metropolitan Phonographic Company on Fifth Avenue and made use of a new technological wonder called the Graphophone, the first practical machine for recording invented by Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Sumner Tainter.  For just under three minutes, the men discussed the events of the year. The original wire recording was placed in the cornerstone box. When the building was demolished in 1955, the box was retrieved and most of the contents given to Columbia. The original wire recording was transferred to reel-to-reel tape and has since been digitized.
