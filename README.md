dlc-metadata-cleanup
====================

Metadata remediation in preparation for ingest into DLC/Staff Viewer/etc. Primarily Omeka collections' metadata. 

This GitHub page will be used to store data, XSLT, and comments/issues found as the collections are ingested and reviewed by the metadata staff.

Omeka -> MODS workflow and documents:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Current Workflow (last updated July 2014):
* Robbie prioritizes exhibitions for remediation based on current needs and notifies Melanie, Amber, and Erin.
* Erin and Amber download the bibliographic/descriptive metadata in bulk for each Omeka Collection.
* Erin and Amber upload the metadata into OpenRefine for remediation following guidelines discussed in Workflow Meeting Notes.
* Once metadata is cleaned, Erin or Amber will upload CSV, Excel, OpenRefine project, and MODS/XML to the wiki page for that particular metadata collection.
* Erin or Amber notifies Melanie and Robbie that the metadata set is cleaned so that they can review. Once they are satisfied, Melanie notifies Fred that the metadata is ready to proceed for Fedora ingest preparation.
* Fred proceeds with transforming cleaned metadata set for upload into Fedora.
* If someone proposes that previously-cleaned metadata sets should be altered/updated, changes are routed to Melanie/Robbie for review and forwarding to either Amber or Erin or, if global changes, Fred. If the files have already been ingested into Fedora, Ben needs to be contacted as well.
